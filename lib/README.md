Pre-compiled libraries. These are provided as-is, and do require auxillary libraries to work.

Mac: Xcode should be installed
Linux: Should work if gcc is installed
Windows: requires gfortran

If these do not work then download the NUMmodel library release 0.91 and compile yourself (https://github.com/Kenhasteandersen/NUMmodel).
