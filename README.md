Code to produce the figures in "From first principles to ecosystem structure andfunction of unicellular plankton":

 * R: the main code to run the figures. Also contains a Shiny app.
 * matlab: code to run the two figures with the water column and global setups
 * lib: Pre-compiled versions of the NUMmodel library needed to do the simulations. Note that you need to rename the library to fit your operating system.
